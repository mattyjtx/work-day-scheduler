# work-day-scheduler

## Description
The work day scheduler is an application to help save important events during every hour of the day from 9am to 5pm. The current time will be shown in header and with every hour that passes, the text area will show gray for current time, green for present time, and red for past time. The save button will allow users to save text even with refreshing page using local storage.
